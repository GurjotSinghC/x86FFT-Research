## FFT-Cooley Tukey Implentation in Mips Simulator


### Resources

* Original Author of C++ Code Dr Chen from Harvard University https://gist.github.com/hsiuhsiu/a0c63f2555f5af7ba622d4e911a68898
*  J. F. JAMES book on Fourier AStudentâ€™s Guide to Fourier Transforms with Applications in Physics and Engineering
*  Please support his book if possible I make no money from you clicking on the Amazon link and I am not paid by Mr. James for promoting his book. As well we have never met
*  https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Fourier-Transforms-Applications/dp/0521176832
### Work Credit
* Dr. Roger Doering without whose guidance this project wouldn't be possible and helped write the complex math operators +,-,divide and multiply and assisted in C++

* I Gurjot Singh wrote the entire FFT algo translated the FFT Algorithm from the C++ code of Dr Chen
* I finally also wish to thank my lab peers who worked alongside me this summer working on differnt projects with Dr Doering
* Jewel Hickman, Sukhpinder Singh

# Step 1
Download Mipsym use either the gui or CLI'
