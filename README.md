## FFT-Cooley Tukey Implentation in Mips Simulator


### Resources

* Original Author of C++ Code Dr Chen from Harvard University https://gist.github.com/hsiuhsiu/a0c63f2555f5af7ba622d4e911a68898
*  J. F. JAMES book on Fourier AStudentâ€™s Guide to Fourier Transforms with Applications in Physics and Engineering
*  Please support his book if possible I make no money from you clicking on the Amazon link and I am not paid by Mr. James for promoting his book. As well we have never met

### Work Credit
Dr. Roger Doering without whose guidance this project wouldn't be possible and helped write the complex math operators +,-,divide and multiply and assisted in C++
I Gurjot Singh wrote the entire FFT algo translated the FFT Algorithm from the C++ code of Dr Chen

# FFT implementation in Mipsym 
# Done by Gurjot Singh under advisement of Doctor Roger E Doering
# Important citation for writing the original C++ code that I translated to Dr. Yi-Hsiu Chen at Harvard University
The FFT algorithm decomposes a signal transform it from time domain to the frequency domain allowing for further analysis. Thereby allowing for 

| Useful Processes: | 
|---:|
| Noise Reduction:  | 
| Filtering:        | 
| Compression:      | 

The Algorithm implemented is implemented in a Mipsym(Trademark of Dr. Roger Doering Phd) an Mips assembly language simulator thereby forcing the use of custom conversion routines to do file I/O on real Doubles

#  How to Use
  ### First Install MipSym from https://mipsym.com
  ### Install this repo into a suitable directory
  ### Write your sample fft data in the Text file labled "Data.txt"
  ### call the function complex.Cooley_Tukey_FFT
