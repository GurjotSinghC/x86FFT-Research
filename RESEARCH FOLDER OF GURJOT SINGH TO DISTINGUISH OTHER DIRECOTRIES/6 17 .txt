same position

full double sided spectrum postiive  

if we were  to change this iterator

celiling later verison of mips  oppcode is e 

fucniton code is e

at fucntin code e fuction code e shoudl say ceil
roudn trunc ceila dn floor

appendix b actual  R4000 R6000

sqrt not aviablef or 2000 

got opcode for it 

ipmlemnet it
absolute value move engative


than four blank opcdoes in fact all 8 fo those  including round trunc ceil adn floor aare actualylimplmented as hyperosnic arcsinhyperoslb


 
 atan2 is used for full cicrlce rsudl,
 
 thats how arg works it uses atan2
 implmenets it in c++ all these funcitns buitl all using uisng x86 
 in the end oding the instruciton n the operands
 
 
 doing iti n high level language
 i qt use assembly lagnuage 
 
 n is data poitns
 
 
 makign a complex unit struture calle dcomplex
 
 oeratrs thata re complex .mul
 
 
 MIGHT AS WELL HAVE DIVISION

 Instead of an internal conversion do a print complex subrotuine
 
 pringitng complex just means using the syscall double twice dropping a j after the second number
 or putting the j in frot hte second uumber
 
 printign a phasor do we evn have anytrthign that reprecent

 This doesnt  inlined 
because it would be better if they passed m and let N 1 shift M
