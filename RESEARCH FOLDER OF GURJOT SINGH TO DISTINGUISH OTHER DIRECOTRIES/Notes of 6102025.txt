went with his check book  in hand  president of harvard
boasting mangin 5 million a yea rbugdet

stanfrod  ao,ed at arcj 1 os risc 5

stack depth  16 32 stack levels  

extreme software 

deal was had 32 registers at any one time

8 of those were fixed 8 were inputs and 8 were outputs

8 were local

every tim you pushed what happend was  inputs become outputs  and new set of inputs

new set of free local variables

some tricky magic manipulating the stack pointers

the stack was borken up into pieces of 8 

bottom 8 were always teh same 8 registers global essetia

inputand output registers
the a registers and v registers


only 8 t regiters

cool was pushed you get a net set of t regietrs

pop but bulding this stakc machine was nuts 

hard enough to gget students to understand

get them to implement it in hardware one quarter at sparc

beatiful its simpel

basic c++ class not a inehrited form the q t stuff


only thign we use form thjose classes is pointers
not 

any pointers all the same size just an address going to refer to pile poitners and card poitners in this code

begin the defintion of the classs game  protected elemetns and publci elments code that cna onyl be accesesd form the class itself

as opposed formpbulci thwih can be accesed

Qlist of pile poitners

tempalte code only poitners one set of code 
if object is incopmitable  completley set of code based on origanl tamplate


only poitners you can use the same piece of code



virtual void redeal() = 0;

makes it a abstract class
must isntant a decdnate class

you must implement redeal in the decenadt class

when we have equal 0 if you dont implement that virtual fucniotn int he decenant the decenant itself becomes bastract

to be instantn it adecanndat must be ipmplate every virtual 0 

redeal 
Gamname 

sometimes its susefull =0  no code for th aparent

the inhrieted clases must impelmetn the code 




not gonna find a rdeal in the game source
no defintion
its the declation

 one ouf games ohh and lets talk about h= Rpeat 
 
 declartion but not defition to do default argemtns
 
 
 if we call this buffer without a parmeter
 
 
 it means we are usnig the zero value and zchances are the deal aglorhtm istn goign to ay ayn attention to the value h  but hard type was used for
 
 spider so you can get one two or 4 suits 
 
 
 Payoff coudlbe moved to palyoff piels
 
 than 
 what htis is gonna do is go toeach pile and see which piel will accept this card
 
 might be that none of themd object
 
 in which case card wont move
 
 
 so playoff all here
 moves through each of the tableau piles
 and tries to playoff the bottom card
 if it succeeds atleast one card in one pass
 
 than it trties again
 
 
 it will kepe doign that until has a pas throuhh the piels wher enothign comes off and it iwll stop
 
 notice playofffall probably has a dintion in game algorhtim i decirebd because it applies othte games
 no sense in rerqritin gfor eveyr game

 p[lyaoff card deinfition in game
 dont need to din in each type of game
 
 
 doubel cik on tableau click palyfofall
 supposed to haev affect on some ofthe gmaes
 
 
 because it has null deifntion
 no default effect
 
 might not be implemtmnted in teh other games
 if its defined at eul 0 if itsnt decant calss itfalls parent and falls into several aleyrs in acnesty
 
 kif yio dont overide you use the parent class defintion
 
 wsignle card befhieor of hta tdpends on the game we playoff
 no behvior but
 we leave it hear to a null aciton

 theres are poitners to rules
 thats what this is rule  * so wehny oug et ot a zero rule we have reached

 you would see that 
 
 it would allow any suit if th epile is empty

 deal is 33 percent fhncae of winning
 
 can get better win rates than that 
 
 it gets to be more like 15 percent
 win rates
 its pretty challenging game
 other two freecell is almost 99 percent winrate
 
 it just takes alot of 
 
 spider is eacsy 80 90 percent winnable
 spidermediu mdrops way down
 
 
 
 
 maybe 40 percent
 spider hard is like 5 percent its reayl really hard
 
 got this new language i wanna use  its  called forth
